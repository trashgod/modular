# Modular Arithmetic Graph

This JavaFX application renders chords connecting points on a circle. Patterns emerge as the controls are adjusted interactively. The project was inspired by [_Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8). Typical images produced by the application resemble the ones shown [here](https://github.com/Tonumoy/Modular-Arithmetic-on-a-Circle-in-Python).

To run the program from the command line, type:

    mvn clean javafx:run
