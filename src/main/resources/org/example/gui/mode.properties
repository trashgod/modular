SRC_OVER=SRC_OVER: The top input is blended over the bottom input.
SRC_ATOP=SRC_ATOP: The part of the top input lying inside of the bottom input is blended with the bottom input.
ADD=ADD: The color and alpha components from the top input are added to those from the bottom input.
MULTIPLY=MULTIPLY: The color components from the first input are multiplied with those from the second input.
SCREEN=SCREEN: The color components from both of the inputs are inverted, multiplied with each other, and that result is again inverted to produce the resulting color.
OVERLAY=OVERLAY: The input color components are either multiplied or screened, depending on the bottom input color.
DARKEN=DARKEN: The darker of the color components from the two inputs are selected to produce the resulting color.
LIGHTEN=LIGHTEN: The lighter of the color components from the two inputs are selected to produce the resulting color.
COLOR_DODGE=COLOR_DODGE: The bottom input color components are divided by the inverse of the top input color components to produce the resulting color.
COLOR_BURN=COLOR_BURN: The inverse of the bottom input color components are divided by the top input color components, all of which is then inverted to produce the resulting color.
HARD_LIGHT=HARD_LIGHT: The input color components are either multiplied or screened, depending on the top input color.
SOFT_LIGHT=SOFT_LIGHT: The input color components are either darkened or lightened, depending on the top input color.
DIFFERENCE=DIFFERENCE: The darker of the color components from the two inputs are subtracted from the lighter ones to produce the resulting color.
EXCLUSION=EXCLUSION: The color components from the two inputs are multiplied and doubled, and then subtracted from the sum of the bottom input color components, to produce the resulting color.
RED=RED: The red component of the bottom input is replaced with the red component of the top input; the other color components are unaffected.
GREEN=GREEN: The green component of the bottom input is replaced with the green component of the top input; the other color components are unaffected.
BLUE=BLUE: The blue component of the bottom input is replaced with the blue component of the top input; the other color components are unaffected.
